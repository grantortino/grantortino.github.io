                <h3>Overview:</h3>
                <p>
                In this site I decided to collect and store all the information about my life, focusing in particular on the professional and artistic aspects. 
                To enclose all the information I intend to share, I have divided the site into four main sections: Know, Work, Play and Meet.
                </p> 
                <p>In the section "Know" I have inserted a complete biography of my life up to now; in "Work" I have inserted all the services I offer professionally; in "Play" instead, I have inserted a list of artistic productions realized up to now while in "Meet" it is possible to get in direct contact with me through an online form.
                Have a good navigation and have fun!

                <h3>My Story So Far!</h3>
                <p>
                I was born in 1982 in Verona, Italy and more precisely in San Michele Extra. I had a normal childhood, including hiking, biking, kicking a ball and sometimes, bursting some firecrackers.
                During my educational development, I immediately identified music, painting and computer science (especially the branch that deals with software development) as my main interests.
                </p>
                <p>
                I started playing guitar when I was very young, fascinated by a live video of Black Sabbath on television. Having been in touch with guys who shared the same passion, I formed almost immediately the first rock band.
                </p>
                <p>
                From that moment on I never stopped playing and composing music, until today.
                Thanks to the music I was able to learn and improve languages, mainly English, developing a real passion for ways of saying and slang. This interest led me to undertake language studies, but without ever getting an university degree.
                </p>
                <p>
                However, music was not the only determining factor in language learning, as it was also thanks to video games that I greatly expanded my lexical skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                Over the years I have been using computers intensively to create images, posters and in a couple of cases, websites for my projects. This allowed me to become familiar with the main software and operating systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                I lived in Verona until I was 26 years old with my father (now deceased) and my mother. In 2008 I packed my things and went to live in Berlin, where I still live.
                </p>
                <p>
                In 2010 I discovered the technique of Vipassana meditation that led me to undertake an intensive and very rewarding volunteer path. For this reason I have lived and traveled between various meditation centers in Europe and India.
                </p>
                <p>
                My goal now is to follow a training course as a web developer that I hope will enable me to travel and work where I like, allowing me to settle in more places, absorbing the culture and language.

            <h2>WORK</h2>
            <article>
                <h3>All the services I offer professionally, such as Language, Tech and a quick overview of other skills I acquired throughout other other work experiences.</h3>
                <h4>LANGUAGES</h4>
                <p>
                I offer a comprehensive service and support in learning English, French and German. This includes syntactic and grammatical analysis; reading and comprehension sessions of texts and audio extracts (such as conversations or interviews) and intensive conversation sessions on topics of your choice. 
                </p>

                <p>
                The language certifications obtained over the years and the continuous exercise and effort in engaging written and oral communication, show competence and reliability.
                </p>
                <h4>TECH</h4>
                <p>
                Although I am not yet fully versed in web development knowledge, I am still able to provide basic advice and help in html and css.
                I also offer support in learning the main office programs such as Word, Excel, Outlook, Chrome and Firefox, Trello and general  scheduling skills in Google Calendar et similia.
